Chathila Ratnatilake's Personal Website Version 1.0


This is a personal website I created in order to store and display who I am as well as my personal accomplishments. The entirety of this multipage website was made purely using ReactJS as well as NodeJS, React-Router-Dom. This is the current completed build, however, many changes are to come as I wish to implement as I begin to find more time within the near future. Stay tuned as I am excited for what's in store! This website was created within the span of 3 full days, beginning on January 14th.

** MOBILE SUPPORT IS IN PROGRESS **
